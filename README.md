# holidaycountdown
Simple countdown with two WS2812B 7-segments.
This was a simple exercise for me to practice project management, code encapsulation, and enclosure building.

libraries used: 

-FastLED.h : Used for WS2812B LED strips

-TimeLib.h : Used for year calculations

-DS3231.h  : Used for I2C real time clock module


(will upload photos later)
